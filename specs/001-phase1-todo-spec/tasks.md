# Tasks: Phase 1 Todo App

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-phase1-todo-spec/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Unit tests will be included for all core functionality to ensure quality and correctness.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan in src/ directory
- [X] T002 Initialize Python 3.13 project with uv package manager
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (black, flake8, mypy)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Create base Task data model in src/models/task.py
- [X] T005 Create in-memory storage implementation in src/lib/storage.py
- [X] T006 Create basic CLI structure in src/cli/main.py
- [X] T007 Setup error handling infrastructure in src/lib/errors.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Add New Todo Task (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to add new tasks to their todo list by providing a title or description

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by calling the add_task function with a title and verifying that the task appears in the list with a unique ID and 'Pending' status.

### Tests for User Story 1 ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [X] T008 [P] [US1] Unit test for Task model validation in tests/unit/test_task.py
- [X] T009 [P] [US1] Unit test for add_task functionality in tests/unit/test_todo_service.py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Create Task model with id, title, status attributes in src/models/task.py
- [X] T011 [US1] Implement add_task function in src/services/todo_service.py
- [X] T012 [US1] Add CLI command for adding tasks in src/cli/main.py
- [X] T013 [US1] Add validation for task title not being empty
- [X] T014 [US1] Implement unique ID assignment for new tasks

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - View All Todo Tasks (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to see all their tasks with their status and unique identifiers

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding tasks and then calling the view_tasks function to verify all tasks are displayed with their IDs and status.

### Tests for User Story 2 ⚠️

- [X] T015 [P] [US2] Unit test for view_tasks functionality in tests/unit/test_todo_service.py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T016 [P] [US2] Implement view_tasks function in src/services/todo_service.py
- [X] T017 [US2] Add CLI command for viewing tasks in src/cli/main.py
- [X] T018 [US2] Format task display with ID, title, and status

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Mark Task as Completed (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable users to mark a specific task as completed using its unique identifier

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a task, calling the complete_task function with its ID, and verifying the status changes from 'Pending' to 'Completed'.

### Tests for User Story 3 ⚠️

- [X] T019 [P] [US3] Unit test for complete_task functionality in tests/unit/test_todo_service.py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T020 [P] [US3] Implement complete_task function in src/services/todo_service.py
- [X] T021 [US3] Add CLI command for completing tasks in src/cli/main.py
- [X] T022 [US3] Add validation for task existence before completion
- [X] T023 [US3] Add error handling for invalid task IDs

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1, 2 AND 3 should all work independently

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Delete Task (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Enable users to remove a task from their list using its unique identifier

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a task, calling the delete_task function with its ID, and verifying the task is removed from the list.

### Tests for User Story 4 ⚠️

- [X] T024 [P] [US4] Unit test for delete_task functionality in tests/unit/test_todo_service.py

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [X] T025 [P] [US4] Implement delete_task function in src/services/todo_service.py
- [X] T026 [US4] Add CLI command for deleting tasks in src/cli/main.py
- [X] T027 [US4] Add validation for task existence before deletion
- [X] T028 [US4] Add error handling for invalid task IDs

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T029 [P] Documentation updates in README.md
- [X] T030 Code cleanup and refactoring across all modules
- [X] T031 Performance validation to ensure operations complete under 1 second
- [X] T032 [P] Additional unit tests for edge cases in tests/unit/
- [X] T033 Error message validation to ensure graceful handling
- [X] T034 Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for Task model validation in tests/unit/test_task.py"
Task: "Unit test for add_task functionality in tests/unit/test_todo_service.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Task model with id, title, status attributes in src/models/task.py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
   - Developer D: User Story 4
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
